# Syntax
#   Definitions are given one per line:
#
#     KEY PROFILE_NAME
#
#   Lines that start with # are ignored
#
#   KEY
#     The key name is calculated by the script. The EASIEST WAY to get the key
#     is to run the command in an unconfigured directory, then the script will
#     tell you the key it's looking for. See the script source to see how key
#     names are calculated.
#
#   PROFILE_NAME:
#     From your ~/.aws/config, e.g. this PROFILE_NAME is foo:
#
#       [profile foo]
#       region = us-east-1
#       aws_access_key_id=...
#       aws_secret_access_key=...
#
#     Or in your ~/.aws/credentials:
#
#       [foo]
#       aws_access_key_id=...
#       aws_secret_access_key=...
